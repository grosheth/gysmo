# gysmo üöÄ

**gysmo** is a fun and visually engaging CLI tool written in Go, designed to enhance your terminal experience. While it does provide system information, its primary purpose is to showcase your stylish terminal setup.

**Key Features:**
- **Highly Customizable:** Tailor gysmo to your preferences with user-configurable settings. The default JSON configuration is cool, but we encourage you to make it your own.
- **Show Off Your Setup:** Perfect for proudly displaying that you use Arch, by the way.
- **Inspired by the Best:** Draws inspiration from [nitch](https://github.com/ssleert/nitch) and [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).

**DISCLAIMER:**
gysmo is not intended to be an accurate system information tool. There are many other tools available for that purpose.

## üì• Installation

### Download the Binary
```shell
wget setup.sh
```

### Home-manager
The program is not included in nixpkgs, I might do it later.
There is still a way to generate your gysmo config with home-manager.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{

}
```

### Build From Source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gysmo.git
cd gysmo
go build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Like I said in the introduction, the default configuration is not meant to be used and although it can show off your system, it also can show anything you want.

Here are every section of the configuration file you can modify:
<details>
  <summary>üìùItems</summary>
  The items section is where you define what you want to show in your gysmo main menu. The following is an example configuration:

  ```json
  "items": [
    {
      "alias": "user",
      "name": "user",
      "icon": "ÔäΩ",
      "value_color": "purple",
      "text_color": "",
      "image_color": "red",
      "value": "Custom value"
    },
    {
      "alias": "name-alias",
      "name": "name",
      "icon": "Óúî",
      "value_color": "purple",
      "text_color": "green",
      "image_color": "red"
    }
  ]
  ```

Here is a brief explanation of each option:

| Option       | Description                                                                 | Example Value       |

| `alias`      | This is the value that will be shown in the middle of the menu.             | `"username"`        |
| `name`       | This is the system value gysmo will return.                                 | `"user"`            |
| `icon`       | An icon to display alongside the item.                                      | `"ÔäΩ"`               |
| `value_color`| The color of the value text.                                                | `"purple"`          |

| `image_color`| The color of the icon.                                                      | `"red"`             |
| `value`      | A custom value to display for the item. (will replace the value returned by the keyword)                                    | `"Custom value"`    |

## Keywords for `name` Option
Some values of /etc/os-release are not available on some distros, look at [os-release](https://github.com/which-distro/os-release) to get an idea.

  <summary>üé® ascii</summary>
I don't aim to keep millions of ASCII art in this repo.

I might open an Issue so people can share their ASCII art.

Instead, I suggest you get the ASCII art you like from the following sources:

### Sources
- [asciiart.eu](https://www.asciiart.eu/) (all the gysmo ASCII art were made there)
- [asciiflow](https://asciiflow.com/#/)


Here is an example of the ASCII configuration:
the ascii section is a simple dictionnary with the following options:

  ```json
  "ascii": {
    "path": "ascii/gysmo4",
    "colors": "red",
    "enabled": true,
    "padding": 2
  },
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìù header</summary>

  ```json
  "header": {
    "enabled": true,
    "text": "NixOS",
    "text_color": "white",
    "line": true,
    "line_color": "red"
  },
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìù footer</summary>

  ```json
  "footer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "text": "gysmo",
    "text_color": "white",
    "line": true,
    "line_color": "red"
  },
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üìù general</summary>

  ```json
  "general": {
    "padding": 2,
    "left_padding": 200,
    "menu_type": "box"
  }
  ```

</details>

Here are some examples of what you can do with gysmo.

### Versioning
A github workflow is in place to automatically bump the version of the project. I will merge the PRs when I am ready.
To version this project, I use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
